As ironic as it may sound, here's the story. <br>
I was working as CS 135 ISA at University of Waterloo. <br>
CS 135 is a first-year course that teaches functional programming using Racket. <br>
In Racket, check-expect is the way one can write test cases for their functions. <br>
One day, some dude went to Piazza and asked if we could read and mark his 1000 check-expects. <br>
As for me, who was dealing with many job-related issues (and quite on the verge of losing sanity), I was pretty upset with that kind of question. <br>
But we answered his question with information about automarking, and basically ignored his "funny story" (according to him). <br>
But I got curious, so I checked out his submission. <br>
Sure enough, he used a script to generate 1000 check-expects since there were classic signs of RNG. <br>
Then I thought to myself, "Well, I can try out something like this." <br>
And that's how this mini project came to existence. <br>
I just want to say that I have no problem with goofing around like this, as long as you don't bother others.
